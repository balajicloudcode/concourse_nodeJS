# Parameterized pipeline tasks

In the same fashion as a method or function in programming languages, Concourse pipeline tasks can be executed with parameterized variables, inputs and outputs.

That allows for the reuse of common task definitions, for example, `package release` or `deploy application`, in multiple contexts and in multiple executions for distinct artifacts.


### Key-value pairs with `params`

Key-value pairs can be passed to a task through a [`params`](http://concourse.ci/running-tasks.html#params) section in the task definition. Each `key` entry will become an **environment variable** during the execution of the task.


### Input and Output Mappings

The `inputs` and `outputs` of a task can be parameterized with [input-mappings](http://concourse.ci/task-step.html#input_mapping) and [output-mappings](http://concourse.ci/task-step.html#output_mapping) respectively.  
That means that an entire input or output folder that is expected by the task (e.g. a github release or S3) can be "substituted" with another folder from a pipeline resource for each run of the task.


### Example

Supposed that individual **Docker Tutorial packages** need to be created for `Java`
and `Go` languages. Each package will contain the same tutorial files, but will
have to ship the specific `Dockerfile` for the corresponding language's docker image.

#### The generic tutorial packager task  

The common task that packages the tutorial files from input `tutorial-release` along with a *Dockerfile* expected from input `dockerfile` into a file name defined by environment variable `$PACKAGE_NAME` would look like this:


```
platform: linux
image_resource:
   ...
inputs:
  - name: tutorial-release
  - name: dockerfile
outputs:
  - name: output-directory
run:
  path: sh
  args:
  - -exc
  - |
    cp ./dockerfile/Dockerfile ./tutorial-release
    tar -cvf ./output-directory/$PACKAGE_NAME ./tutorial-release
```

#### The pipeline definition file

The excerpt of a pipeline definition file below uses the task above (stored in the `common-tasks` git repository as `package-with-dockerfile.yml`) to create two tutorial packages: one for `Go` and one for `Java`.  

There are two jobs in the pipeline that invoke the `package-with-dockerfile.yml`
task, each one passing in specific `input-mapping` and `params` attributes.  

The `input_mapping` section maps the expected `dockerfile` input to the resource that
contains the corresponding *Dockerfile* for each language (e.g. `java-dockerfile` for Java, `go-dockerfile` for Go).

The `PACKAGE_NAME` param creates the environment variable that defines the package file name (e.g. `java-docker-tutorial.tgz`) to be created.


```
jobs:
...
- name: Package-Java-Tutorial
  plan:
  - get: tutorial-release
  - get: java-dockerfile
  - get: common-tasks
  - task: package-java-docker-tutorial
    file: common-tasks/.../package-with-dockerfile.yml
    input_mapping:
      dockerfile: java-dockerfile
    params:
      PACKAGE_NAME: java-docker-tutorial.tgz

- name: Package-Go-Tutorial
  plan:
  - get: tutorial-release
  - get: go-dockerfile
  - get: common-tasks
  - task: package-go-docker-tutorial
    file: common-tasks/.../package-with-dockerfile.yml
    input_mapping:
      dockerfile: go-dockerfile
    params:
      PACKAGE_NAME: go-docker-tutorial.tgz

resources:
- name: tutorial-release
  type: git
  source:
    uri: https://github.com/docker/labs.git

- name: java-dockerfile
  type: git
  source:
    uri: https://github.com/dockerfile/java.git

- name: go-dockerfile

```

### Run the sample pipeline

Download the complete pipeline file for the sample above from [here](package-tutorials.yml) and then set a pipeline with it on your
Concourse server to inspect the results of the parameterized tasks feature.
