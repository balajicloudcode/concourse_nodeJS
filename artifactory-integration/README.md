# Artifactory integration with Concourse pipelines
A best practice in continuous integration pipelines is to "[only build packages once](https://continuousdelivery.com/implementing/patterns/)" and then consume that same version of the produced artifacts in later steps of the pipeline (e.g. app deployment, functional/integration tests).  
In order to implement this pattern in a pipeline, integration with artifacts repositories are commonly used.  
This article provides a sample for the integration of JFrog Artifactory, a popular artifact management software in the market, with a Concourse pipeline.  

The example uses the [Artifactory resource](https://github.com/pivotalservices/artifactory-resource) to deploy and retrieve artifacts to/from an Artifactory server.  

This pipeline implements the pattern of (1) saving a produced versioned build artifact to a repository/folder in Artifactory and (2) retrieving the same file in a subsequent pipeline step, which is triggered once a new file version is detected in the Artifactory repository/folder.

## How to setup and run the sample pipeline in Concourse

##### Pre-requisites

1. An instance of [Concourse installed](http://concourse.ci/installing.html) up-and-running.  
1. The [Concourse Fly command line interface](http://concourse.ci/fly-cli.html) installed on your local machine.  
1. A JFrog Artifactory server up-and-running.  
   For local tests, you can [run Artifactory as a Docker image](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Running+with+Docker).  


##### Configuration steps
1. Download the provided sample [pipeline.yml](https://github.com/pivotalservices/concourse-pipeline-samples/blob/master/artifactory-integration/pipeline.yml)  

2. Edit pipeline.yml and update the parameters for the **artifactory-repository** definition:  
  * Replace "*ARTIFACTORY-HOST-NAME-GOES-HERE:8081*" with the hostname and port number of the Artifactory server. e.g. ```http://192.168.99.100:8081/artifactory```  
  * Replace "*/repository-name/sub-folder*" with the location of the files in Artifactory. e.g. */ext-release-local/myapp*  
  * Replace "*/repository-name/sub-folder*" with the location of the files in Artifactory. e.g. ```/ext-release-local/myapp```  
  * Update the **regex** property with the expression that represents the file name of your artifact along with the location of its version information. e.g  ```my-artifact-(?<version>.*)-release.zip```  
  * Replace "*YOUR-ARTIFACTORY-USERNAME*" and "*YOUR-ARTIFACTORY-PASSWORD*" with the username and password (respectively) authorized to deploy files to Artifactory.  


3. Configure the sample pipeline in Concourse with the *fly* command:  
   __fly -t <your-concourse-alias> set-pipeline -p artifactory-pipeline -c pipeline.yml__  

4. Access to the Concourse web interface, click on the list of pipelines, un-pause the _artifactory-pipeline_ and then click on its link to visualize its pipeline diagram
5. To execute the pipeline, click on the ```1-build-an-artifact``` job and then click on the ```+``` sign to execute the pipeline.

After job ```1-build-an-artifact``` is executed, you should see a new version of the created file in the Artifactory server. Subsequently, you should see job ```2-trigger-when-new-file-is-added-to-artifactory``` automatically triggered to retrieve that latest file version from Artifactory.
